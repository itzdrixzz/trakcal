# Trakcal

## Description

**Trakcal** is a fitness and calorie tracking mobile app that I am creating to help myself lose weight. I started Trakcal after trying multiple different calorie tracking apps that all worked—until the time came to pay for the subscription. I didn’t have the money to pay, so I just stopped working out.

I’m creating this app in hopes that it will motivate me to get healthy without the extra costs.

Trakcal is built using:

* Expo
* React Native
* NativeWind
* Clerk Authentication
* Convex
* Open Food Facts

## Installation Guide

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Then start the Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the output, you’ll find options to open the app in a:

* Development build
* Android emulator
* iOS simulator
* Expo Go (a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo)
